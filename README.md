# My Portfolio Backend
This is the backend for my personal portfolio website, built with **Flask**.  
It handles contact form submissions and stores them in a **SQLite** database.
The backend is connected to the live frontend hosted on GitHub Pages. Visitors can use the contact form on the site to send me a message.

##  Live Frontend
The portfolio website is live here:

Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000


Contact Form Flow

1. A visitor fills out the form on the portfolio site. 
2. The data (name, email, message) is sent to the backend.
3. The backend stores the message in messages.db.
4. The user is redirected to a thank you page.

â¸»

Database

This app uses SQLite (messages.db) to store the messages.
To view the content of the database, you can use tools like DB Browser for SQLite.

.gitignore

venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.db
.env

This file ensures local development files like the virtual environment and database are not uploaded to GitHub.
